When a designer deletes one component in dialog flows, the system will move it to the recycle bin.  The designer can recover it from the recycle bin.

## Supported component types
- User node
- Bot node
- Form
- Slot
- Interrupt
- Goto

## Insert a component 
* Select `What can i do for you today?` bot node in the recycle bin and drag it to the node to be linked. When the `+` icon appears, release it.
  <br/>The node will be inserted behind the node you dragged to.

 [It seems the following is just the repeat of the insertion operation?  If so , probably we can delete it.] 

## Insert node
* The preparation is shown in the lower flow chart. We add a user input node between the bot reply nodes

* Move the later `What can i do for you today?` bot node to the trash
  ![03-trash](/assets/images/tutorial/trash/03-trash.png)
* Add new bot input node
  ![04-trash](/assets/images/tutorial/trash/04-trash.png)
* Select the `What can i do for you today?` bot node in the trash and drag it to the bot node just created. When the `+` icon appears, release it
  ![05-trash](/assets/images/tutorial/trash/05-trash.png)
* Finish

## Delete intermediate nodes using the trash
* The preparation is shown in the lower flow diagram. We use the trash to delete the user input node between the two bot reply nodes
  ![06-trash](/assets/images/tutorial/trash/06-trash.png)

* Delete the later `What can i do for you today?` bot node  to the trash, and it will be automatically moved to the trash
  ![07-trash](/assets/images/tutorial/trash/07-trash.png)

* Delete user input node`Nice to meet you too`
  ![08-trash](/assets/images/tutorial/trash/08-trash.png)

* Select the `What can i do for you today?` bot reply node in the trash and drag it to the bot reply node `What is your name?`, Release the `+` icon when it appears
