Sometimes we delete a node or multiple nodes by mistake.  Undo/Redo will help us go back to the previous step.  Suppose we have the following conversation flow.

![001-redo_undo](/assets/images/tutorial/redoundo_example_1.jpg)

We delete the last bot response node as shown in the figure. 

![02-redo_undo](/assets/images/tutorial/redoundo_example_1_1.jpg)

We click `undo` to restore the deleted bot node.

![03-redo_undo](/assets/images/tutorial/redoundo_example_1_2.jpg)

We click `Redo` to delete the recovered bot node again.
